Justification - Out of both Naive Bayes method and SVM method, considering the accuracy and comprehensive evaluation metrics, Naive Bayes proves to be the more efficient algorithm for the specific dataset and problem. It exhibits superior overall performance and achieves a higher accuracy rate in comparison to SVM.

There are two program files with name ICP5_Firstprogram, ICP5_Secondprogram. There is one documentation file which consists of the executed python code along with the output result.
